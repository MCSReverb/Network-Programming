# Threaded Matrix Multiplication

Threading is often used in network computing to minimize latencies. This project demonstrates matrix multiplication 

> These projects are from the Networks & Distributed Computing course at California State University, Long Beach. Some features may not yet be fully implemented.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository at this [link](https://github.com/rgabeflores/Network-Programming.git).

2. Navigate to a desired project folder.

3. Open a terminal in the directory and run the `make` command

> NOTE: Most of the projects are written for POSIX systems, thus requiring a POSIX based OS for compilation.

## Running the Program

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.

2. Create two files containing the matrices values with the following format:


```
	1 2 3
	4 5 6
	7 8 9
```

3. Call the `Aprog` executable with the proper arguments using the following command:

```
	./Aprog inputA1.in inputA2.in
```
